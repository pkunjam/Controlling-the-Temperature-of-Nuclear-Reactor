# Controlling the Temperature of Nuclear Reactor

This project is made using Raspberry Pi 3, We have used Temperature Sensor(DS18B20) that is connected to Arduino via 4K7 Resistor, We have used Arduino to monitor the temperature status repeatedly, RPi is connected to Relay module which cuts off the power supply to the heater in reactor when the specified temperature is reached and two LEDs are connected to represent the current status of reactor i.e. whether the coolant is active or the heater.
